[This bot allows you to display DnD related info in your DC chat. 
Topic it covers include: rules, items, classes and features, races, spells, backgrounds, feats.

Write any of these commands below to ask your wise Sage a question about D&D mechanics

COMMANDS:
Before command use prefix "?" or mention a bot by typing @Sage RPG

"help"      - command used to show this panel
"sage       <any phrase you want to search for> <optional flags>" - see more below 
"classes    <class name>                        <optional flags>"
"race       <race name>                         <optional flags>"
"spell      <spell name> "
"feat       <feat name> "
"background <background name> "

ARGUMENTS:
Instead of brackets in list above enter according phrases you wish to see. 
Eg: Instead of: feat <feat name> write ?feat Chef or @Sage RPG feat chef or any feat name, do similar with other commands

?SAGE:
Unique and universal command, it has the ability to find answers for most of your questios, but there is bigger chance that it will take sligthly longer to execute. In opposition to other commands you can make misspell mistakes.
Eg: ?sage tiefling Eg2: @Sage RPG sage armor -f shield Eg3: ?sage fight -f mounting

FLAGS:
If command has <optional flags> argument you can use flags bellow:

"-s <phrase>" - use this flag with ?classes only, lets you see certain subclass/maneuvers/invocations, 
depending on phrase you have given. 
Eg: ?classes rogue -s arcane trickster | It will show you info about rogue subclass - arcane trickster

"-f <phrase>" - use with any command where optional flags are available, bot will look for phrase you have given
 and will display only this content that is relevant to this phrase. 
 Eg: ?sage elf -f wood elf | It will show you only information about wood elf, not whole elf race. 
 Eg2: ?sage paladin -f divine smite | It will show you only Divine Smite feature, not whole paladin class]
